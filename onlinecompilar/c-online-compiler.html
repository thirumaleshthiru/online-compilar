    <h2 >What is our Online C Compiler</h2>
    <p>Our Online C Compiler is a web-based tool   to write, compile, and execute C code directly from your browser. You can write your C programs in the provided editor, compile them with the click of a button, and see the output in real-time.</p>
    <h2 >Features of Online C Programming Compiler</h2>
    <p>1. You can write and run your C program instantly without the need to install any software or set up a development environment for C language.</p>
    <p>2. You can use functions like scanf() to accept user input for interactive program execution and testing.</p>
    <p>3. You can also save your code to your sytstem in <strong>.c</strong> extension file.</p>
    <p>4. You can also use our tool with your smart phone.</p>
    <p>5. We are using VS Code like editor.</p>

    <h2 >What is a Compiler</h2>
    <p>A compiler is a  software program that takes the code written by people in languages like C, Java or C++ and turns it into instructions that computers can understand and follow. 
    When programmers write their code in a text editor or a program like Visual Studio Code, the compiler reads through it, figures out what it means, and changes it into a version that the computer can use.</p>
    <p>The output of a compiler is customized for specific types of computers and the systems they run on. This output, called object code, is made up of binary numbers (1s and 0s) that the computer's processor can handle directly. For example, if you're working on a Linux computer with an ARM processor, the compiler will generate code that works specifically for that setup.</p>
        <p>Some compilers do things a bit differently. Instead of turning code directly into instructions for a specific computer, they create something called bytecode. Bytecode is like a middle step. It's not specific to any one computer system. Instead, it's designed to work with something called a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which translates the bytecode into instructions that the computer can understand. 
        Bytecode can also be quickly turned into instructions by a just-in-time compiler.</p>
<p>There are also compilers that translate code into another high-level language instead of machine code or bytecode. These are called <strong>transpilers</strong>. </p>
   
<h2 >How does a compiler work?</h2>
<p><strong>Lexical Analysis: </strong>The compiler breaks down the source code into smaller parts called <strong>lexemes</strong>, which represent specific patterns in the code.
These <strong>lexemes</strong> are then organized for further analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Syntax Analysis: </strong>The compiler checks if the code follows the rules of the programming language. It creates a structured representation of the code to understand its logic.
</p>
<p><strong>Semantic Analysis: </strong>The compiler ensures that the code makes logical sense. It verifies if variables are used correctly and if the code behaves as expected.</p>
<p><strong>Intermediate Representation (IR) Generation: </strong>The compiler creates an intermediate version of the code to simplify the translation process into different formats. This version must accurately represent the original code.
</p>
<p><strong>Maximization: </strong> The compiler enhances the intermediate code to improve its performance or reduce resource usage. Users may have options to adjust the level of optimization.
</p>
<p><strong>Output</strong> Finally, the compiler produces the actual code that the computer can comprehend and execute. This marks the completion of the compilation process.</p>

<h2>C Programming Basics</h2>
<p>C programming language is a widely-used programming language, was developed by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Laboratories in 1972. Even though it's old, it's still very popular because it's important in computer science.

</p>
<p>C is closely linked with UNIX since it was created to build the UNIX operating system..</p>
